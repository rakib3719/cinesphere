# Cinesphere

This project is built using Next.js and includes features like SSR, ISR, CSR, mock memory storage, and various libraries for form validation and API response validation. Itâ€™s designed to offer a smooth and professional UI with efficient data handling.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run this project on your local machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Open your terminal and execute the following command:

   ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/rakib3719/cinesphere.git
   cd <project-directory>

   2.**Open the app in your browser:**

Once the server is running, open http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

## Technologies Used

### Next.js
This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), leveraging:
- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**: For optimal page load performance and SEO benefits, especially for pages that require up-to-date data on each request.
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**: Allows pages to be statically generated at build time and updated incrementally, ensuring both performance and freshness of data.
- **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)**: Employed for dynamic user interactions and components that need real-time data updates, such as the watchlist feature.

### Mock Memory Storage
For testing and development purposes, this project uses **Mock Memory Storage** as a simulated database. This allows testing without the need for actual persistent storage, streamlining development and ensuring functionality before connecting a full database.

### Zod
[Zod](https://zod.dev/) is used for **API response validation**. It ensures that incoming data is accurate, secure, and follows expected formats. This validation process prevents data discrepancies and enhances API robustness.

### React Hook Form
The project incorporates [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for managing form inputs, ensuring efficient handling of form states and validation. This is particularly useful in search and other form components, where responsive and user-friendly validation is essential.
